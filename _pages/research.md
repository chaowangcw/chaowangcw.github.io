* ["Identification of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models with Hyperbolic Discounting Using a Terminating Action"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4126360) with Ruli Xiao and Stefan Weiergraeber (submitted) 
    We study the identification of dynamic discrete choice models with hyperbolic discounting using a terminating action. We provide novel identification results for both sophisticated and naive agentsâ€™ discount factors and their utilities in a finite horizon framework under the assumption of a stationary flow utility. In contrast to existing identification strategies we do not require to observe the final period for the sophisticated agent. Moreover, we avoid normalizing the flow utility of a reference action for both the sophisticated and the naive agent. We propose two simple estimators and show that they perform well in simulations.

* [**"Subsidizing Electric Vehicles among Heterogeneous Consumers: Does Vehicle Holding Matter?"**](/files/EV_Chao_JMP.pdf)

    In the United States, most households can access one or more vehicles. I study the impact of household vehicle holding heterogeneity on subsidy policy design in promoting electric vehicles (EV). Using consumer vehicle surveys in California, I find households without vehicles have higher vehicle purchase propensity and households with EVs are more likely to buy another EV than households with gasoline vehicles. I then develop a structural model of household automobile choice incorporating vehicle holdings. Combining market sales data and survey information, I identify the vehicle holding heterogeneity effect and quantify its welfare implications. My model predicts similar overall EV sales but different responses among heterogeneous households compared to the standard demand model without vehicle holding heterogeneity. Counterfactual simulations suggest that redistributing subsidy amounts across households with different vehicle holdings can raise EV sales by 8% without augmenting subsidy expenditure, with the cost of reducing consumer surplus by 0.1%.To achieve the same level of EV sales under the current subsidy scheme, the government needs to pay $81.6 million more in the subsidy budget.

* [**"Identification of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models with Hyperbolic Discounting Using a Terminating Action"**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4126360) with Ruli Xiao and Stefan Weiergraeber (Revise-and-resubmit at **Journal of Business & Economic Statistics**) 
    
    We study the identification of dynamic discrete choice models with hyperbolic discounting using a terminating action. We provide novel identification results for both sophisticated and naive agents’ discount factors and their utilities in a finite horizon framework under the assumption of a stationary flow utility. In contrast to existing identification strategies we do not require to observe the final period for the sophisticated agent. Moreover, we avoid normalizing the flow utility of a reference action for both the sophisticated and the naive agent. We propose two simple estimators and show that they perform well in simulations.

* [**"Identiﬁcation of hyperbolic discount factor in dynamic discrete choice model with multiple terminating actions"**](/files/hyperbolic_multiple_terminating_action.pdf)
    
    This paper studies identification of quasi-hyperbolic discount dynamic discrete choice models in both finite and infinite horizons, exploring the unique features of the presence of multiple terminating actions. Under economically meaningful exclusion restrictions, the identification of discount factors is characterized by polynomial moment conditions. The presence of multiple terminating actions greatly reduces the complication of the identification and also helps relax the restrictions imposed on the flow utility function. This paper also examines the impact of estimating the `underlying' hyperbolic discounting model as the prevalent exponential discount model. I find that such misspecification could lead to misleading policy implications.
